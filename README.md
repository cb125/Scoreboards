# Keeping track of conversations: Scoreboards, Semantics and Psychology

[Chris Barker](https://cb125.github.io), [Liz Camp](https://www.elisabethcamp.org), and [Andy Egan](https://www.andyegan.net/)

## Course Description

"Flatness": that the content of utterances are simply sets of worlds, rather than something more dynamic or more complex.

Attractions of flatness: flatness embodies instrumentalist informational imperialism in its purest form.  We posit contents as context sets in order to model and predict evolution of conversations. More fine-grained distinctions are mere notational devices. No imputed correspondence for context sets to independent reality, either a) objective metaphysical entity or b) participants’ psychological states. 

The flat picture is initially theoretically compelling because parsimonious and unifying. How satisfying is it? Motivations for complexifying: 

* Not all updates alter which possibilities are in the context set
* Not all updates have the same conversational status
* Not all updates are fixed by composition on conventional meaning 
* Explanatory relevance requires some kind of grounding, whether in actual psychological states or in constructed social structures. 
 
Which of these complexities should be modelled within a linguistic theory?  A semantic theory? Why does it matter?  Which linguistic ‘weeds’ does it affect? 

## Course Expectations: 
All participants must do the reading and post forum comment/question in advance of class. The post must discuss something you genuinely don’t understand, and should be anchored in a specific part of the text. (Not a fancy counterexample or a general rant.)
**Zoom stance**: The course is about in-person interaction. That said, zoom is not out of the question, under certain limited circumstances.

**Work**: 
* Research option: 25 page response paper
* Non-research option: 6 page focussed point or squib
* Auditors are welcome, and are expected to do the reading

## Course Schedule

The course is sponsored jointly by the Philosophy department at Rutgers and the Linguistics department at NYU.  When at NYU, the sessions will take place in room 103 at 10 Washington Place (the Linguistics building), from 11:00 -- 1:45 on Wednesdays.  When at Rutgers, the sessions will take place ...
